		<h2>How do the download counts on NPM work?</h2>

				>Every HTTP 200 response served that are tarballs is counted as a download.</a
            > NPM themselves states <blockquote>"Bot filtering is really hard, and never totally accurate, and requires constant manual intervention or crazy machine learning to get right, and we are not an analytics company."</blockquote> 
            NPM <b>does not</b> filter any bots <b>at all</b> from the download count. 
        </p>
        <h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
        <p>
            I've spoken to end-users of NPM packages, and I found that for most of them, they would trust a package with more downloads than one with less. 
            This seems fairly rational to me, as to most people, more downloads = more users, which equals more reliability. 
            By having someone being able to fake millions of downloads in only a few minutes, having a download counter almost doesn't make sense.
            To demonstrate this point, I took a small package I created about two weeks before, and ran a simple script that faked my download counts. <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-adler">
            This is the package.</a> (It's a small package implementing Adler32 into Javascript, mainly meant for internal usage.) In fifteen minutes, the download counts were at over a million. Obviously, this is fake.
            (The package normally gets 4-5 downloads a week.) 
            <br><br>
            I implore NPM to do something about this, or at least remove the download count from publicly facing NPM pages.
        <h2>Want to try it yourself?</h2>
        <p>I made a small webapp as a proof of concept for this idea. I don't recommend actually using it as it could put a strain on NPM servers. 
            It's very rudimentary and I'm sure somebody could optimize the process if they put their minds to it.
