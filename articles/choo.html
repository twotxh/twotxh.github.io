    <h2>What is Choo Choo?</h2>
    <p>
      Choo Choo is a project I've worked on for a while. It's a bot that uses
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov chains</a> to
      generate semi-complete sentences from a provided dataset.
    </p>
    <h2>Wait, what dataset?</h2>
    <p>
      I run choo choo on a Discord server, and with permission of the server
      owner, I used the excellent tool of
      <a href="https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter"
        >Discord Chat Exporter</a
      >
      to export all the servers' channels in plaintext.
    </p>
    <h3>Our first issue</h3>
    <p>
      While an excellent tool, DiscordChatExporter was built to be human
      readable. The Plaintext option was of course helpful, but it outputted
      text like: <pre><code class="plaintext">==============================================================
Guild: Server Name
Channel: Main Channels / test
==============================================================

[13-Mar-21 07:08 PM] vstp#4582
Test
{Embed}
https://embedlink.com

==============================================================
Exported 1 message(s)
==============================================================</code></pre>
This was not ideal for our purposes (The output with this dataset would be full of "=" and "{" signs and dates and usernames, none of which we want.)
It was clear I needed a way to get rid of these without going through 140,000 messages manually.
This was my solution.
<pre><code class="sh">sed '/^\[/d' $1 > /tmp/txt1
sed '/^{/d' /tmp/txt1 > /tmp/txt2
sed '/^$/d' /tmp/txt2 > /tmp/txt3
head -n -4 /tmp/txt3 > $1
rm /tmp/txt1
rm /tmp/txt2
rm /tmp/txt3</code></pre>
This script removed all lines that started with {, [, or $ and then removed the first four lines from the text.
This was pretty much the best I could get without manually editing the files.
    </p>
<h2>The code</h2>
<p>
I wrote Choo Choo in Rust, using the incredibly helpful <a href="https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity">Serenity</a> library to communicate with Discord.
<pre><code>async fn message(&self, ctx: Context, msg: Message) {
        if (msg.author.bot) {
            return;
        }
        if msg.channel_id != 799350790476922910 {
            return;
        }
        let cache = markov::create_cache(include_str!("./log.txt")
        .split_whitespace()
        .map(|x| String::from(x))
        .collect());
        if let Err(why) = msg
            .channel_id
            .say(&ctx.http, markov::generate_text(cache, 10))
            .await
        {
            println!("Error sending message: {:?}", why);
        }
    }</code></pre> This was the first draft. It was horribly inefficient for two main reasons.
The cache was regenerated on every new message, and the tokens were regenerated on every new message.
My first thought was to offload the cache creation to static variables, but since it required function calls to non-static functions, 
that wasn't an option. Except, one day, I stumbled across <a href="https://docs.rs/lazy_static/1.4.0/lazy_static/">lazy_static</a>.
By moving both the token and cache creation to a setup like this: <pre><code class="rust">lazy_static! {
    static ref TOKENS: Vec<String> = include_str!("../all.txt")
        .split_whitespace()
        .map(|x| String::from(x))
        .collect();
    pub static ref CACHE: std::collections::HashMap<std::string::String, std::vec::Vec<std::string::String>> =
        markov::create_cache(TOKENS.to_vec());
}</code></pre> To get this to work, I had to have the markov implementation import the struct of CACHE and accept that instead of the previously accepted HashMap.
<h2>The results</h2>
The results, while not perfect, are fairly good considering the speed the program runs at. On my home internet connection of ~250 Mbps and an i5-3230M @ 2.6 GHz, the program takes ~100ms to respond.
Some sample messages from the bot are provided below, seperated by a new line:

I'm still looking for optimizations, and I'll keep this page updated. <br>
