		<h1>A simple XKCD Parser for random comics</h1>

        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>
            I love XKCD. It's my favourite webcomic. I've bought all of Randall Munroe's books, and they sit on a proud spot on the top of my bookshelf, but often I find it annoying to click the next or random button, especially if the image changes sizes. It's just not a good format for me to read.
            That's why I created this.

        <h2>Technical aspects</h2>
        <p>This project didn't take that long, but I ran into one monumental challenge. CORS. While XKCD does have a wonderful API, it is not CORS enabled. I either had to abandon the project or use a CORS proxy.
            My first choice was cors-anywhere. It's a wonderful service that allows you to bypass CORS. However, it didn't fit this projects needs. I continously got rate limited after ~1 minute of testing (about 10 requests).
            I don't intend to blame cors-anywhere for this, their decision for rate limits was rational. However, I needed a better service for this project. That's when I stumbled upon <a href="https://github.com/mrmartineau/xkcd-api">xkcd.now.sh.</a>
            This service is a direct mirror of the XKCD API with one change: CORS was enabled. I quickly integrated it into the web app, and it worked perfectly.

            You can test it out below.
